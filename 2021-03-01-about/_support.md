**What is LINK Journal?**

Because we see design as a process, a methodology, and a language - this project aims to translate information and communicate knowledge to other change makers, looking at the space between the start and the end of a design process, making it experimental, open and design-led.

LINK Journal is a trans-disciplinary journal exploring [in-between] spaces, modes of communication, and translations within creative practices. It is an enquiry into future thinking and cultural shifts.

Together with creatives and forward thinkers we explore, in this first issue "States of Matter", how we will learn to adapt to changing materiality of digital systems, along with the impact of the interdependency between the physical and digital spaces we find ourselves in today.

LINK Journal primarily translates as an open-source project, to be made available physically and digitally. It is focusing on the process of creating and designing collaboratively, and will be translated in its tangible form of communication, through the chosen medium of a book.

We will progressively document the entire process of this project and collaborations, so make sure to keep an eye on [link-journal.com].
